# Project Idea: Bitcoin Price Prediction and Analysis
Predict Bitcoin prices using historical data and machine learning models in Python.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle, link of dataset used in this project is provided in dataset.txt file as the dataset size was quite big.

#### Description:
This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data and various machine learning models. The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building predictive models. The goal is to understand the underlying patterns in Bitcoin prices and develop a reliable forecasting model.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Obtain historical Bitcoin price data from a reliable source (e.g., Kaggle).
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
   - Convert the date column to a datetime format and set it as the index.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize Bitcoin price trends over time using line plots.
   - Calculate and plot daily and weekly returns to understand price volatility.
   - Perform rolling statistics to analyze moving averages and standard deviations.
   - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features such as lagged prices, moving averages, and technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).
   - Analyze the correlation between Bitcoin prices and other financial assets (e.g., S&P 500 index).

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Implement various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM) for price prediction.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
   - Fine-tune the models and select the best-performing model.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Visualize the predicted vs. actual prices.
   - Summarize findings and insights from the EDA and predictive modeling.
   - Create a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook with clear explanations and visualizations.

6. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Integrate sentiment analysis of Bitcoin-related news or social media posts to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Explore advanced deep learning models for time series forecasting.
